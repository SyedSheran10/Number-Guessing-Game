# Number-Guessing-Game
Our C++ Number Guessing Game is an interactive and entertaining application that challenges players to guess a secret number within a specified range. Built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this game offers a seamless and intuitive user experience while showcasing fundamental C++ programming concepts.

Upon launching the game, players are presented with a welcoming interface that prompts them to input their guesses. The game generates a random number within a predefined range, and the player's objective is to guess this number correctly. With each guess, the game provides feedback to guide the player towards the correct answer.
